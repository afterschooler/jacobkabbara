        <h2>1. Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+</h2>
        <p>Top Speed: 304mph</p>
        <p> Price: $3 900 000</p>
        <p>Specifications: Quad-turbo 8.0-litre W-16 engine with 1,600 horsepower</p> 
        <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
        <p>The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ is a high performance variant of the Chiron hypercar that set an unofficial production car speed record of 304.77 mph (490.48 km/h). On 2 August 2019 Bugatti presented a limited production high performance variant of the Chiron called the Chiron Super Sport to owners taking part in the company's 110th-anniversary tour in Europe. The variant is limited to 30 examples and closely resembles the prototype performing the top speed record run. Changes from the standard Chiron include a more powerful engine, increased top speed, and a characteristic paint scheme featuring a lacquer-coated carbon fibre body with orange stripes, echoing the aesthetics of the company's previous top speed record-breaking cars, the Veyron Super Sport World Record Edition and the Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse World Record Car. The car is powered by a 1,175 kW (1,580 hp; 1,600 PS) quad-turbocharged W16 engine shared with the Bugatti Centodieci, nicknamed "Thor". This car has a grey Bugatti logo made of black enamel and silver, the exhaust system from the Centodieci, a modified gearbox with longer ratios and front and rear bumpers optimised for aerodynamics at high speed, resulting in the overall length increase of the car by 248.9 mm (9.8 in).
        The Super Sport 300+ will also be equipped with a top speed limiter, akin to the one found in the standard Chiron. Without the limiter, Bugatti claims that the car can attain a maximum speed in excess of 483 km/h (300 mph). Bugatti will also prepare the cars of owners who want to take the car to its full potential at the Ehra-Lessien test track.</p>

        <h2>2. Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut</h2>
        <p>Top Speed: 300+mph</p>
        <p>Price: $3 000 000</p>
        <p>Specifications: Twin turbocharged V8 engine with 1280 horsepower</p>
        <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
        <p>Unveiled online alongside the Gemera on 3 March 2020, the Jesko Absolut is a high speed version of the Jesko. The rear wing on the Jesko Attack is replaced by two rear fins which enable a reduction in downforce from 1,400 kg (3,086 lb) to 150 kg (331 lb) and a drag coefficient of Cd=0.278. The front splitter and side winglets are removed and the front louvers are smoother with the rear wheels featuring removable covers for high speed stability. The vehicle is also slightly elongated featuring a rear extension which adds 85 mm (3 in) of additional length. The engine and transmission remain the same as the Jesko Attack. 3,000 hours were spent on the aerodynamic analysis while an additional 5,000 hours were spent design and engineering work of the Absolut. The Absolut will be priced higher than the Jesko due to the development work taken to lower the drag coefficient. The Jesko Absolut is claimed by the manufacturer to have a top speed in excess of 480 km/h (300 mph), with theoretical spеeds as high as 530–560 km/h (330–350 mph) in the right conditions.</p>

        <h2>3. SSC Tuatara</h2>
        <p>Top Speed: 295 mph</p>
        <p>Price: $1 600 000</p>
        <p>Specifications: Twin turbo V8 engine with 1,750 horsepower</p>
        <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
        <p>The SSC Tuatara is the successor to the SSC Ultimate Aero and the result of a design collaboration between Jason Castriota and SSC. SSC has plans to launch the car in 2017. A production version of the SSC Tuatara was shown in August 2018.The SSC Tuatara uses an in-house-developed billet-aluminum 6.9L (6,941 cc) twin-turbocharged V8 engine redlining at 9,200 rpm and delivering a minimum of 1350 hp (1007 kW) and 1042 ft·lb (1413 N·m), both at 6,800 rpm, while the car runs on 91 octane unleaded premium petrol gas. The V8 engine will be capable of higher outputs of up to 1700 hp (1268 kW). The car weighs 2750 lb (1247 kg) thanks to its carbon fiber construction (wheels included) and aluminum crumple zones; all this will allow the Tuatara to manage a power-to-weight ratio of over 1,000 hp per tonne.
        SSC claims that the Tuatara's 0-60 mph sprint will be done in 2.5 seconds, the quarter mile in 9.75 seconds at 144 mph (232 km/h), and the projected speed 276 mph (444 km/h). The Tuatara will record 1.05 g on the skidpad and brake from 60 mph (97 km/h) to a stop in 103 ft (31 m).
        SSC showcased the car's pre-production prototype and components in 2011. Production of the car had been delayed multiple times until 2017, when SSC North America's new headquarters will be at West Richland, Washington. The Tuatara is scheduled to be released in the 2019 model year, with an improvised appearance and produces 1,750 bhp with E85 flex fuel. Its main competitor is the Bugatti Chiron, the Koenigsegg Regera and the Agera RS, and the Hennessey Venom F5.</p>

        <h2>4. Pagani Huayra</h2>
        <p>Top Speed: 238mph</p>
        <p>Price: $20 000 000</p>
        <p>Specifications: AMG derived twin-turbocharged V12 engine with 730 horsepower</p>
        <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
        <p>In March 2021, Pagani introduced the Huayra R, a track-only version of the Huayra and the successor of the Pagani Zonda R. The Huayra R uses the "Pagani V12-R", a 6.0 L naturally aspirated V12 engine built from the ground up with HWA AG to produce 850 PS (625 kW; 838 hp) at 8,250 rpm as well as 750 N⋅m (553 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 5,500 rpm to 8300 rpm, and a redline at 9,000 rpm. And it is likely that the new engine was based on the architecture of the M120 engine block by Mercedes-AMG. The Huayra R has a 6-speed sequential transmission newly developed for the car, and various weight saving measures have resulted in a lower dry weight of 1,050 kg (2,315 lb).
        Pagani plans a limited 30-car production run for the Huayra R, similar to the limited 15-car production run of the track-only version of the Pagani Zonda, the Zonda R. It will cost €2.6mln + taxes (around $3.1mln + taxes).</p>

       <h2>5. Rimac Nevera</h2>
       <p>Top Speed: 258mph</p>
       <p>Price: $3 000 000</p>
       Specifications: 1,914 horsepower</p>
       <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
       <p>The Rimac Nevera is an electric sportscar designed by Croatian manufacturer Rimac Automobili. The original Nevera concept was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show and named Rimac C_Two, as it was the second car manufactured by the company (after the Rimac Concept One); subsequently, the C_Two was given its current name when it entered production in 2021, with the first production model delivered to 2016 Formula One World Drivers' Champion Nico Rosberg in August 2022. The name "Nevera" comes from the Croatian word for a storm system that is typically accompanied by lightning and mainly occurs in the Adriatic Sea around the coast of Croatia.
       The Nevera's exterior is designed by Croatian-born Austrian Adriano Mudri, taking some cues from the Concept One but incorporating new features, such as butterfly doors and an active spoiler. Each of the Nevera's four wheels are powered by an oil-cooled, single-gear electric motor that give a combined power output of 1914 hp (1427 kW) and 2360 ft·lb (3200 N·m) of torque. The Nevera draws power from a lithium/manganese/nickel battery with a capacity of 120 kWh, giving it an advertised maximum range of 647 km (402 mi) on the NEDC cycle and 490 km (300 mi) on the WLTP cycle. The battery can be charged to 80% capacity within 30 minutes when it is connected to a fast charger. An on-board NVIDIA Drive Pegasus supercomputer, capable of processing 6 TB of data per driving hour, combined with a brake-by-wire system, electric power steering and ultrasonic proximity sensors, gives the Nevera autonomous driving capabilities as well as on-track driving assistance.</p>

       <h2>6. Mclaren Speedtail</h2>
       <p>Top Speed: 250mph</p>
       <p>Price: $452,075</p>
       <p>Specifications: 4,0 litre, twin-turbo V8 engine with 1050 horsepower</p>
       <b><p>Additional Information</p></b>
       <p>The Speedtail is powered by a modified M840T from the 720S and a hybrid powertrain to generate 1,036 hp (773 kW; 1,050 PS). The Speedtail uses a carbon fibre monocoque, with the passenger seats integrated into the chassis, as well as dihedral doors like other McLaren models.
       The company claims that the Speedtail has a top speed of 402.3 km/h (250 mph) and can accelerate from 0–299 km/h (0–186 mph) in 12.8 seconds.Testing was done in Florida at the Kennedy Space Center at the Johnny Bohmer Proving Grounds. The shuttle landing runway was used for the tests. It also tested in tracks in Germany, Spain and Italy.
       In November 2018, McLaren planned to build 106 examples of the Speedtail, all of which have already been sold, at an MSRP of around £2.1 million. Due in part to its use of cameras in lieu of side mirrors and no side-mounted airbags, the Speedtail is not street legal in the United States, even though around 35% of the total cars were bought by American buyers. A spokeswoman for the company stated that the car may be legal, pending approval by NHTSA, to be imported into the U.S. under the “Show or Display” law, which exempts cars that are “historically or technologically significant" from NHTSA safety standards but requires that owners not drive the vehicle more than 2,500 miles in a 12-month period. McLaren has made it clear that they will not offer assistance with importing or registering the Speedtail in the U.S.
       Production of the McLaren Speedtail commenced in the United Kingdom after high-speed testing was completed by December 2019. The prototype XP2 version had "reached its terminal velocity more than 30 times," topping out at 250 mph (403 km/h), and able to go from a standstill to 186 mph (300km/h) in less than 13 seconds. The first deliveries, 106 cars, were slated for February 2020 to Woking, England.</p>
